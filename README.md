### Setting up a Game

When starting the game in GUI mode you will immediately be prompted to choose your game options. For the best experience as a new player using the default setting are recommended. 

##### Rows and Columns

While a standard game of Othello should be played on an 8 by 8 board, players looking for a different experience can try boards of various sizes. Row and column values may be an whole number from 4 to 16 and the board does not have to be square.

##### Who goes first

By default, black moves first, but this may be changed by selecting 'White' under 'Who goes first?'

##### Starting Layout

The starting layout of the board puts two of each players' pieces in the center 4 spaces of the board. By default, black's pieces are located in the upper left and lower right of these two positions, with white's pieces occupying the remaining two spaces. You can specify starting with the opposite layout by selecting 'White' instead of 'Black' under the starting layout section.

##### Victory Conditions

By default, the player who owns the most pieces, when no valid moves remain for either player, is the winner. However, players may choose to play an alternate version of the game, in which they compete to own the least amount of pieces at the end of the game, by selecting 'Least Pieces' as the victory condition.

### Rules of the Game

For detailed rules, see the [Reversi Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi#Rules) on Wikipedia. Please note that the initial setup and starting player are the opposite of the official Othello layout, although this can be changed by user (see above). Manual placement of the first four pieces on the board, as specified by the rules of classic Reversi, is not supported by this version of the game.
