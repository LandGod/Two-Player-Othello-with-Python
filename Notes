-In my console UI I neglected to catch IndexError's resulting from user input. I had set things up to handle
    a ValueError exception, but I neglected to realize that I could get unusable values that would be passed in, but
    not be valid.

-Probably have a bunch of variables that are self., but don't need to be in othello_configure

Known Bugs:
-Startup setting dialogue is sent behind root window upon creation (and using the 'after' method or 'get_focus' doesn't
    seem to do anything at all (much less help me).
